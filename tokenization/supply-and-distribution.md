total supply is x and is distributed as follows

* private token sales
* public pre-sale

## Tokenomics

The emission pool will be injected directly into the POLIS rewards pools via a smooth curve over 8 years, dropping the entire rewards pool over this time â€” unless the DAO rules otherwise (with a supermajority). The vision for the DAO interventions is that the organization will set semiannual targets based on the observed economic metrics which will adjust the dropping schedule accordingly
