Each planet is divided into parcels. Specifics of each parcel (i.e. size, borders, location, current ownership) are recorded as on-chain NFT. All buildings are naturally built on land, with higher-end facilities requiring more developed land to function. All land is owned rather than rented, protecting users from eviction or discrimination by rent application. To disincentivize flipping—whereby a market agent would buy and simply hold land, planning to gain revenue from its value appreciation rather than its usage—the game utilizes Land Value Tax (LVT).&#x20;

The DAO prices land tax in FaceOff depending on its level (the more developed land is taxed more), with the global limits adjustable by the top-level DAOs. This mechanism provides dynamic protection from flipping and balances land value with its potential productive capabilities. If the land owner does not pay taxes, the land will eventually be foreclosed, disabling all buildings (but not stopping tax accrual). After an additional period, the land can be auctioned by local governance, recapturing back taxes and a fine, and returning the remaining funds to the original owner
